# weather-app
// Weather app that displays weather information for a given location
The weather app code is a PHP script that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to display the current weather information for a selected state in Nigeria. 

The script retrieves the weather data from the API based on the user's selection of a state from a drop-down list, and then displays the city name, temperature, and weather description on the webpage. 

The script also includes CSS styling to enhance the user interface and improve the overall user experience. This weather app code can be easily integrated into any PHP project or used as a standalone application to provide current weather information for users.
